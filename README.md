# Stock-Market-Prediction
This project builds a predictive model to analyze stock market returns using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and regression modeling. Key insights reveal that Real Total Return Price and Real TR Scaled Earnings are the dominant drivers of market performance. The model achieves high accuracy (R² ≈ 0.969) and generalizes well for unseen data.
